# Our Favorite Things — Group GitHub Project

Welcome to our collaborative HTML project! This is a fun and simple web page where each team member will add a list of their favorite things — such as books, movies, food, or anything else you like!

This project is designed to help us learn how to work together using GitHub. We'll use branches and pull requests to contribute to the same file without overwriting each other’s work.

## Project Files

- `index.html` — The main HTML file where everyone adds their own section
- `style.css` (optional) — For light styling (if anyone wants to style the page)
